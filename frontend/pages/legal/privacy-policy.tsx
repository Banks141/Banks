              <p>
                CalOPPA is the first state law in the nation to require commercial websites and online services to post
                a
                privacy policy. The law’s reach stretches well beyond California to require a person or company in the
                United
                States (and conceivable the world) that operates websites collecting personally identifiable information
                from
                California consumers to post a conspicuous privacy policy on its website stating exactly the information
                being
                collected and those individuals with whom it is being shared, and to comply with this policy. – See more
